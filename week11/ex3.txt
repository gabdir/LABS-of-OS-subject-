Because of the line buffering of the I/O
"Hello" string prints twice in the first 
program. Fork() method copies the process 
and also copies the buffer. 

In the second program output is only one 
"Hello\n" line and two empty lines. After 
fork() method call both buffers will be 
empty, they will just printing "\n" line
